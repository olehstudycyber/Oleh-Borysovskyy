# OpenVAS Scan Detection via Sysmon (Server 2025)

## 🧪 Scenario
A full, quick vulnerability scan was launched from a Kali Linux machine using OpenVAS against Windows Server 2025 (IP: 192.168.1.2). Sysmon was actively logging all activity on the server during the scan to capture forensic data.

## 🔍 Sysmon Configuration

| Component       | Details                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Host            | Windows Server 2025        |
| Sysmon Log File | servOpV.evtx               |
| Logging Tool    | Microsoft Sysmon           |
| Duration        | Start ➝ End of OpenVAS scan|
| Network Attacker| Kali Linux (192.168.1.10)  |

## 🧠 Detected Events (From servOpV.evtx)

| Event ID | Description            | Indicator                              |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 3        | Network connection     | Connection from Kali (192.168.1.10)     |
| 1        | Process execution      | Possible detection of `nmap`, `Nikto`   |
| 11       | File creation          | Possibly from tool payloads             |
| 7        | DLL loaded             | System components during scan activity  |

> ✅ These events confirm that the scan footprint was captured by Sysmon.
