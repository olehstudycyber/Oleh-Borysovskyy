### Nmap SMB Vulnerability Scan

- `smb-vuln-ms10-054`: false
- `smb-vuln-ms10-061`: Failed to negotiate a connection

### smbclient

- Initial attempt failed due to syntax issue: used `-N~` instead of `-N`
- Needs re-run with proper options after ensuring `smbclient` is installed

**Next Steps:**
- Retry with: `smbclient -L //192.168.1.2/ -N`
- Test access to specific shares if discovered
