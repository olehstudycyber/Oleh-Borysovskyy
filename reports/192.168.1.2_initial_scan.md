## üîé Initial Port Scan (Nmap)

A TCP SYN scan (`-sS`) with service version detection (`-sV`) was run against a set of commonly abused service ports.

**Command:**
```bash
nmap -sS -sV -p 53,67,68,69,123,161,162,500,514,520 192.168.1.2

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.2
Host is up (0.0069s latency).

PORT     STATE    SERVICE     VERSION
53/tcp   open     domain      Simple DNS Plus
67/tcp   filtered dhcps
68/tcp   filtered dhcpc
69/tcp   filtered tftp
123/tcp  filtered ntp
161/tcp  filtered snmp
162/tcp  filtered snmptrap
500/tcp  filtered isakmp
514/tcp  filtered shell
520/tcp  filtered efs

MAC Address: D8:CB:8A:9A:F6:29 (Micro-Star Intl)
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
Findings:

Port 53 (DNS) is open and running Simple DNS Plus.

All other scanned ports are filtered, suggesting a firewall is actively blocking them.

The host is running a Windows OS, and the MAC address was successfully identified.

üì¶ Comprehensive TCP Port Scan
A full TCP scan was executed to identify additional services, particularly HTTP and RPC endpoints.

Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -sS -sV -p- 192.168.1.2
Results (partial):

bash
Copy
Edit
PORT      STATE SERVICE       VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh           OpenSSH for_Windows_9.5 (protocol 2.0)
53/tcp    open  domain        Simple DNS Plus
88/tcp    open  kerberos-sec  Microsoft Windows Kerberos
135/tcp   open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
389/tcp   open  ldap          Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds  ?
464/tcp   open  kpasswd5      ?
593/tcp   open  ncacn_http    Microsoft Windows RPC over HTTP 1.0
636/tcp   open  tcpwrapped
3268/tcp  open  ldap          Microsoft Windows AD Global Catalog
3387/tcp  open  http          Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)
3389/tcp  open  ms-wbt-server Microsoft Terminal Services
5357/tcp  open  http          Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0
5504/tcp  open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
5985/tcp  open  http          Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0
9389/tcp  open  mc-nmf        .NET Message Framing
49664‚Äì49709/tcp open          msrpc (various endpoints)
50000/tcp open  ldap          Unknown
64721/tcp open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
New Findings:

SSH (22/tcp) is open, indicating remote access is enabled.

Multiple Microsoft services are exposed (RPC, Kerberos, LDAP, SMB).

HTTP endpoints were found on ports 3387, 5357, and 5985, all running Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0.

üåê Web Server Scanning (Nikto)
Nikto was used to identify common misconfigurations and missing headers on the detected HTTP services.

Port 3387
Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
nikto -h 192.168.1.2 --port 3387
Result:

X-Frame-Options header is missing ‚Äî may allow clickjacking attacks.

Port 5357
Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
nikto -h 192.168.1.2 --port 5357
Results:

X-Frame-Options header is missing.

X-Content-Type-Options header is not set ‚Äî potential for MIME sniffing vulnerabilities.

Port 5985
Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
nikto -h 192.168.1.2 --port 5985
Result:

Same issues detected: X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options headers missing.

üß† Summary of Findings

Port	Service	Finding
22	SSH	OpenSSH for Windows 9.5, remote access enabled
53	DNS	Simple DNS Plus running
3387	HTTPAPI 2.0	Missing security headers
5357	HTTPAPI 2.0	Missing security headers
5985	HTTPAPI 2.0	Missing security headers
389, 3268	LDAP	Active Directory exposed
135‚Äì49709	RPC-related	Various Windows RPC interfaces exposed
‚úÖ Next Steps
Investigate the purpose and exposure risk of HTTP ports 3387, 5357, 5985.

Research and apply hardening for missing headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).

Follow up with vulnerability-specific scanners (e.g., OpenVAS, Nessus) to gain deeper insights.

Review RPC exposure and limit access to internal trusted hosts.

Assess authentication and patch level of services such as Kerberos, LDAP, and SMB.
