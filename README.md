- **TryHackMe SOC & Blue Team Labs – Level 0xC (Guru, 33k+ points)**  
  Completed blue-team and SOC-focused rooms covering SIEM use, log analysis, incident handling, and Windows/network forensics, applying ATT&CK techniques and mapping detections to tactics to simulate real SOC workflows.

## 🛠 Lab Environment

- Home SOC lab with Windows Server and Windows 10/11 clients
- Kali Linux and Ubuntu for offensive and administrative tasks
- Wazuh/Splunk for centralized logging and alerting
- Microsoft Defender and Windows native logging (Security, Sysmon)
- Virtualization using Oracle VirtualBox/VMware
