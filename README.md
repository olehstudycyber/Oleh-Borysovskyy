<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Physical Cybersecurity Lab:</h2>

* **Physical Lab Penetration Testing:**
    * **[Build Server (Hardware Requirements)](BUILD_SERVER.md)** - Detailed description of the build server setup.
    * **Lab Setup:**
        * üñ•Ô∏è **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux (Dell Laptop) - `192.168.1.10`
        * üè¥ **Target Machine:** Windows Server 2025 - `192.168.1.2`
        * üåê **Networking:** Netgear Router, Static IPs
        * üõ†Ô∏è **Security Tools:** Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Snort
    * [Active Directory Bulk User Creation](Link to project if available)
    * Cisco Packet Tracer: Used for network diagram creation and simulation.
    * **Description:** This lab allows me to practice penetration testing in a controlled environment, testing various security tools and techniques.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Virtual Cybersecurity Labs:</h2>

* **Host Setup:** (Hardware & Hypervisor details - *e.g., "Running on a Dell XPS 15 with VMware Workstation"* )
* **Network Foundation:** (pfSense) - pfSense is used as a firewall and router to segment the virtual network, simulating a real-world network environment and allowing for controlled traffic analysis.
* **Security Monitoring:** (Security Onion) - Security Onion is a network security monitoring (NSM) platform. I use it to capture and analyze network traffic, detect intrusions, and generate alerts.
* **Attack Simulation:** (Kali Linux) - Kali Linux is my primary attacker machine, equipped with tools for penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and exploiting security weaknesses.
* **Domain Environment:** (Windows Server & Desktops) - Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10/11 desktops simulate a corporate network with Active Directory, allowing me to practice domain security and attack techniques.
* **Log Management:** (Splunk) - Splunk is used for centralized log management and analysis, enabling me to monitor system activity, detect anomalies, and investigate security incidents.
* **Description:** These virtual labs help me simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios and hone my skills in network security and attack simulations.

<h2>Certificates</h2>

* [Prep for passing ComTia Security+ exam](link to documents or projects)
* **Description:** This section showcases my commitment to continuous learning and certification in cybersecurity.
