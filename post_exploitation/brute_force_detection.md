# 🛡️ Day 2 - Brute Force Attack Simulation (RDP/SSH)

## 🎯 Lab Goal  
Simulate a brute-force attack on a Windows Server 2025 target and verify detection through logs and security tools.

## 🧪 Lab Setup

| Component         | Detail                     |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Attacker Machine | Kali Linux (192.168.1.10)  |
| Target Machine   | Windows Server 2025 (192.168.1.2) |
| Tool Used        | Hydra                      |
| Wordlist         | rockyou.txt                |
| Services Targeted| RDP (3389), SSH (22)       |

## 🔍 Phase 1: Reconnaissance

**Command (Kali):**
```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.2
Discovered Services:

RDP: Port 3389 open

SSH: Port 22 open

🚨 Phase 2: Brute-Force Simulation
Commands (Kali):

bash
Copy
Edit
hydra -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.1.2
hydra -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.2
Actual Outcome:
RDP: Hydra failed to establish a connection to port 3389.

SSH: Command executed, but success/failure not confirmed in screenshot.

Screenshot:
📸 Kali terminal output showing connection failure (optional if captured)

🛡️ Phase 3: Detection & Logging Analysis
🔐 Windows Defender
Status: ❌ No Alert

Notes: No alert triggered, likely due to failed connection not reaching authentication layer.

📁 Event Viewer – Windows Server 2025
Security Logs:
Event ID 4625 – Failed Logon

Multiple failed logon attempts targeting administrator.

Logon Type: 10 (RemoteInteractive) for RDP.

Source IP: 192.168.1.10

Note: If Event ID 4625 not observed, explicitly state this. Failed connections may still generate 4625 logs.

Sysmon Logs:
Event ID 10 – Process Access: Could indicate network authentication-related access.

Event ID 1 – Process Creation:

Captured creation of C:\Windows\explorer.exe

Note: Likely normal activity, not linked to Hydra brute-force.

📘 Notes / Lessons Learned
Brute-force attempts generate Event ID 4625, useful for detection.

RDP attempts are marked by Logon Type 10.

Defender may not alert on basic brute-force attempts (especially failed connections).

Sysmon offers process-level visibility, especially with Event IDs 1 and 10.

Hydra's failure to connect to RDP highlights importance of validating attack execution.

Key defensive measures:

Account lockout policies

Strong password policies

IDS/IPS integration (e.g., Wazuh or Snort)

✅ Security+ Objectives Covered
2.1: Compare and contrast common threat actors and motivations

2.2: Analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks

2.4: Analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack
