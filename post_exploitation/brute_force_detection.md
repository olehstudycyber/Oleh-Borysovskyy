# 🛡️ Day 2 - Brute Force Attack Simulation (RDP/SSH)

## 🎯 Lab Goal
Simulate a brute-force attack on a Windows Server 2025 target and verify detection through logs and security tools.

## 🧪 Lab Setup

| Component        | Detail                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Attacker Machine | Kali Linux (192.168.1.10)   |
| Target Machine   | Windows Server 2025 (192.168.1.2) |
| Tool Used        | Hydra                       |
| Wordlist         | rockyou.txt                 |
| Services Targeted| RDP (3389), SSH (22)        |

---

## 🔍 Phase 1: Reconnaissance

**Command (Kali):**
```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.2
Discovered Services:

RDP: Port 3389 open

SSH: Port 22 open

🚨 Phase 2: Brute-Force Simulation
Commands (Kali):

bash
Copy
Edit
hydra -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.1.2
# or
hydra -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.2
Expected Outcome:

Numerous failed login attempts on the target

🛡️ Phase 3: Detection & Logging Analysis
🔐 Windows Defender
Status: [✅ Alert Triggered | ❌ No Alert]

Notes: [Include if any alert appeared or was silent]

📁 Event Viewer
Security Logs
Event ID 4625 - Failed Logon

Shows multiple failed logins using account administrator

Indicates attempted logon type (e.g., 10 = RDP)

Source IP may be visible (192.168.1.10)

Sysmon (if installed)
Event ID 10 - Process Access: Traces unauthorized process access (Hydra not running on Windows, but can show local effects)

Event ID 1 - Process Creation: Less likely unless related processes triggered

📘 Notes / Lessons Learned
RDP and SSH brute-force attempts are logged under Event ID 4625.

Defender may not trigger without signature behavior (depending on config).

Sysmon helps with deeper context on what was accessed or triggered.

Ensure account lockout and detection policies are enabled for brute-force protection.

✅ Security+ Objectives Covered
2.1: Compare and contrast common threat actors and motivations

2.2: Analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks

2.4: Analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack (e.g., brute-force)
